Let's say our input is the simple question: "What is machine learning?"

1\. Tokenization
----------------

First, the input text is converted into tokens (subword units).

```
Input: "What is machine learning?"
Tokens: ["What", " is", " machine", " learning", "?"]

```

Each token is assigned a unique integer ID from the model's vocabulary:

```
Token IDs: [1484, 318, 6582, 4370, 30]

```

2\. Embedding Layer
-------------------

Each token ID is converted into a high-dimensional vector (embedding).

If our model has an embedding dimension of 4096:

```
Token ID 1484 ("What") → [0.12, -0.34, 0.56, ..., 0.78] (4096 values)
Token ID 318 (" is") → [-0.45, 0.23, 0.67, ..., -0.12] (4096 values)
...and so on

```

This creates an embedding matrix of shape [sequence_length, embedding_dim] = [5, 4096]

3\. Positional Encoding
-----------------------

Position information is added to each token embedding, either through:

-   Additive positional encodings (older models)
-   Rotary position embeddings (RoPE) (newer models)
-   Alibi position biases

4\. Transformer Blocks
----------------------

The embedded sequence passes through multiple transformer blocks (e.g., 32-80 layers). Each block contains:

a) **Self-Attention**:

-   Calculate Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices for each token
-   Compute attention scores: softmax(QK^T / √d)
-   Weight values by attention scores: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T / √d)V
-   For multi-head attention, this process happens in parallel across multiple "heads"

b) **Feed-Forward Network**:

-   Apply two linear transformations with a non-linearity (typically GELU) in between
-   FFN(x) = GELU(xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂

Each component has residual connections and layer normalization.

5\. Final Output Layer
----------------------

The final transformer block output is converted to logits over the vocabulary:

-   Linear transformation to map hidden states to vocabulary size
-   Output shape: [sequence_length, vocab_size]

6\. Sampling for Generation
---------------------------

For the first generated token:

-   Apply softmax to get probability distribution over vocabulary
-   Select next token using sampling strategy (greedy, nucleus, temperature)
-   Let's say the model predicts "Machine"

7\. Autoregressive Generation
-----------------------------

-   Add the newly generated token to the input sequence
-   Run steps 1-6 again with the updated sequence
-   Continue until EOS token or maximum length

8\. Speculative Decoding (Optional)
-----------------------------------

To optimize throughput:

-   Predict multiple tokens at once (e.g., 5-10 tokens)
-   Verify predictions with a single forward pass
-   Only recompute when predictions diverge

Example Generation Flow
-----------------------

For our input "What is machine learning?", here's how tokens might be generated:

1.  **First Pass**:
    -   Input: ["What", " is", " machine", " learning", "?"]
    -   Output token: " Machine"
2.  **Second Pass**:
    -   Input: ["What", " is", " machine", " learning", "?", " Machine"]
    -   Output token: " learning"
3.  **Third Pass**:
    -   Input: [..., " Machine", " learning"]
    -   Output token: " is"

... and so on until the complete response is generated:

"Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn from data without being explicitly programmed..."

Each step involves matrix multiplications, attention calculations, and non-linear transformations across thousands of dimensions, making this a computationally intensive process---but highly optimized in modern implementations.

This simplified implementation demonstrates the key components of an LLM and how they work together during text generation. Here's a breakdown of the main parts:

1.  **Tokenization**: Converting input text to token IDs (greatly simplified in this example)
2.  **Embedding Layer**: Converting token IDs to high-dimensional vectors
3.  **Positional Encoding**: Adding position information to the embeddings
4.  **Transformer Blocks**: The core architecture with:
    -   Multi-head attention mechanism
    -   Feed-forward neural network
    -   Residual connections and layer normalization
5.  **Output Layer**: Converting hidden states back to vocabulary logits
6.  **Text Generation**: Autoregressive token generation with sampling
7.  **Speculative Decoding**: A separate class showing how to speed up generation by predicting multiple tokens at once

This code is intentionally simplified for clarity and wouldn't produce meaningful text without training. In real LLMs:

1.  The tokenization would use subword algorithms like BPE or SentencePiece
2.  Models would have many more layers (32-80+) and much larger embedding dimensions (4096-8192+)
3.  Various optimizations would be applied for memory efficiency and speed
4.  Advanced attention patterns might be used (e.g., grouped-query attention, sliding window)
